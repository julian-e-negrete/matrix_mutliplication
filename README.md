you only have to execute the .exe file that has been already compiled and if you want to check the logic of the program you just have to take a look at the .cpp file

The logic behind the program is based on this mathematic ecuation

# dimensions
// remember that a multiplication of two matrices is posible when the matrix B hast the same number of rows as the numbers of columns in A
A = m x n
B = n x p
C = m x p


$C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} A_{ik} \times B_{kj}$

 i = m
 j = p
 k = n
